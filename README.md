# Listinha API

This project is about an API to a Full Stack application about a market list and organization of food stock at home. I
decided to create this project with **Typescript**, **Express**, **Prisma**, **Jest**, **Postgresql** and **Docker**. In
terms of architecture, I used the **clean architecture** and, to develop all features of the project, I used the **Test
Driven Development (TDD)** approach.

## How to execute?

To execute this project is necessary to have **Docker** installed in your computer. Besides that, to start the API, you
can run in your terminal, at the root of this project, the command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

For default, the api is running at the port `8080`.
